# ChallengeTwo
This project was meant to display ongoing development of a deeper understanding of html and css.
This project will be used in the future to display my newest projects to potential employers.
I started out with a completely different website look at first, which I overhauled using various sources on w3schools.com, my tutor from bootcamp, and the Xpert Learning Assistant. 
I also used the Xpert Learning Assistant to help with debugging my code.
